# Classic_Image_Classifier
Takes the MNIST dataset and trains a classifier to predict numbers. This is a project from O'Reilly's Hands On Machine Learning textbook. 

Disclosure: Hard coded everything except for the graphs which I copied from the Github for this project. - [Link](https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml3/blob/main/03_classification.ipynb)
